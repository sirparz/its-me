# Personal Portfolio Website

This is Codecademy Fullstack Engineer Career Path Portfolio Website. I have to make a static website where I can share the projects that I build in this Path. I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build the webpage, and this is my first time tracking works using the Git feature.

## Things to do
_This website is far from completed and will be used for the rest of my fullstack engineer career._
- Add Hamburger Menu for Mobile
- Make Contact Page Separate from the Home Page as the requirement. Include a contact form, LinkedIn contacts, etc.
- Fix the clickability of project section to use `<a>` rather than JavaScript onclick feature.
- Make the color hover correspond with the project status.
- Periodically update the project list.
